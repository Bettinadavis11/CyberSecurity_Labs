# Scenario
Courtesy of a limited threat intelligence report, it was revealed that the malware analytics.exe was installed by a tool called analyticsinstaller.exe. Copies of both specimens are included with the report. The CEO of Falsimentis has asked you not to upload the specimens to any online sites. You will need to perform this analysis without the aid of external analysis sites.
Since the file analyticsinstaller.exe is new to the scenario, the system administrator asked you to analyze this file.
